<h1>Project Euler</h1>
<p>
<p>Project Euler is a free set of computational problems and puzzles.<p>
<p>The problems do not specify a method of solution; part of the fun is in the solver's freedom to approach each problem however they like.<p>
<p>The complete project, including all problems and additional information, can be found at <a href="https://projecteuler.net">the Project Euler website.</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>I have made the repository containing my actual work private in keeping with the wishes of Project Euler, but my files can be made available given certain contexts.</p>
<p>My progress in the project is visible at <a href="https://projecteuler.net/progress=becquerel">my profile's progress page.</a></p>
