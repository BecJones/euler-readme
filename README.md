<h2>Project Euler</h2>
<p>Project Euler is a free set of computational problems and puzzles.<p>
<p>The problems do not specify a method of solution; part of the fun is in the solver's freedom to approach each problem however they like.
The complete project, including all problems and additional information, can be found at <a href="https://projecteuler.net">the Project Euler website.</a></p>
<p>I have made the repository containing my actual work private in keeping with the stated wishes of Project Euler, but my files can be made available given certain contexts.
My progress in the project is visible at <a href="https://projecteuler.net/progress=becquerel">my profile's progress page.</a></p>
