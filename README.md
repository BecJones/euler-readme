Project Euler

Project Euler is a free set of computational problems and puzzles.
The problems do not specify a method of solution; part of the fun is in the solver's freedom to approach each problem however they like.
The complete project, including all problems and additional information, can be found at:

This is my first real attempt at Project Euler.
I am working primarily in Vim on Debian 10: Buster x64, through a few different terminals on different computers with different desktop environments; notably, LXTerminal in LXDE, and Konsole in KDE Plasma 5.

My repository is organized first by language, and then by problem number.
I am currently attempting to solve the problems in C, but I may revisit them  and try in other languages as well.
Without knowing how large a given problem's solution could get, I thought it best to give each problem its own directory from the start.
The C directory contains a master test makefile for all completed problems.
Each problem's directory contains a text "statement" file containing the problem number, title, and any supplemental description.
