Project Euler

Project Euler is a free set of computational problems and puzzles.
The problems do not specify a method of solution; part of the fun is in the solver's freedom to approach each problem however they like.
The complete project, including all problems and additional information, can be found at:
https://projecteuler.net

I have made the repository containing my actual work private in keeping with the wishes of Project Euler, but my files can be made available given certain contexts.
